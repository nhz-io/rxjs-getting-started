# RxJS pluralsight gettings started

Course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/reactive-programming-rxjs-getting-started  
Built solution: https://nhz-io.github.io/rxjs-getting-started/

## Overview

Minimal project structure to be able to run through the course.  
This differs slightly from what is presented during the course, some noticeable changes:  

* RxJS downgraded to v4 (v5 is beta, api is broken - at least while i was messing with it)
* Console messages are being redirected to the webpage, to avoid opening devtools for naught
* Using [run-gen](https://github.com/nhz-io/run-gen) to sequence the steps and not mess with async

### P.S.
The course is introductory level, consulting RxJS docs and other kosher info is a must.
